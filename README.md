# CYCLO_COMPLEXITY 


This program is used to calculate the cyclomatic code complexity of the repository using Rest services. In this program flask is used for the rest services
The code is written in python 3.6.
The pre-requisites for the code is pygit2 (get repo and to get commits), Flask (for the rest service), request (post and get)
To find the code complexity, First run the master.py by command python master.py the server is created in local host network using port 5000
and run the slave.py by command python slave.py
We can observe in the results that as the number of worker or slave increases the execution time decreases
The graph obtained from the output is
